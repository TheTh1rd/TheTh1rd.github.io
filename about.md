I am Lorenzo Pizarro a software developer and all-around computer enthusiast. It all started with joining a lego robotics team with some guys from my little league baseball team and ever since then I have been fascinated with all things computers. I graduated in 2018 from Cedarville University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. Since then I have been working as a software developer consultant.
