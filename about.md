I am Lorenzo Pizarro a software developer and all-around computer enthusiast. It all started with joining a lego robotics team with some guys from my little league baseball team and ever since then I have been fascinated with all things computers. I graduated in 2018 from Cedarville University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. Since then I have been working as a software developer consultant.

 I consider myself a continuous learner and hope to use this site as an exciting way to display some of the things Iâ€™m learning about. As well as show off my current hobbies. This website is created using Jekyll and is hosted on Github pages. However, it is currently a work in progress as I am in the process of learning more about web design and styling.
